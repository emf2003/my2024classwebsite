## My Hobbies!

In my spare time, I love to crochet, play video games, and watch thrillers/horror movies. 

I am currently working on crocheting a beta fish. I am using color-changing yarn, that goes from red to white to blue. 

I am really into Stardew Valley right now! It is a really cute farming game, that also includes combat and quests. 

I finally watched "American Psycho" for the first time! It was good, but not as good as "The Ring" (my all-time favorite creepy movie).
